<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this project, we implement a variety of different functionality in simulating how a cloth would behave.
    We start out by generating a matrix of mass points using the given parameters. These mass points serve as a discrete representation of the continuous class.
    In order to model the behavior of a cloth staying together and folding, we add Structural, Shearing, and Bending springs between the points in order to model the different forces of the cloth.
    Then, we add the logic for the effect that gravity has on individual points as well as the forces of the strings, and use verlet integration in order to model the transition time step to timestep.
    Afterwards, we add logic for the cloth to interact with objects, specfically spheres and planes.
    Additionally, we add logic so the cloth folds over itself, rather than clipping through itself.
    Lastly, we implement different kinds of shaders, including diffuse, phong, and more.
